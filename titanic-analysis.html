missing values\n\nHandling missing values is a crucial part in feature engineering when working with data. There are many approaches to this issue, and we should defenitely try to avoid removing complete rows or columns from the dataset, due to the dataset size. We will try to impute missing values based on data distribution and prediction.\nIn this notebook we will go through the taken steps in handling missing values in Titanic Dataset. The following features with missing values were imputed in the dataset:\n* Age\n* Embarked\n* Fare  \nThe features _ticket, cabin, boat, body and home\\_destination_ will be unfortanutely removed from the dataset, since they contain many missing data fields, and imputing these values can give us false information based on the dataset size.

Titanic Dataset is a very well known Kaggle competition, and many people have provided very clever and interesting ideas to deal with the dataset. While dealing with missing values, we will use ideas shared by [Megan L. Risdal on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.io/svf/924638/c05c7b2409e224c760cdfb527a8dcfc4/__results__.html), since this approach is quite interesting.\nSince the dataset is small in size, we will do the age imputation in R, using [Mice](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mice/index.html) package. We will impute missing age values without some of the columns that give us less useful information. The code for the R script is available in a file _ageImputation.R_.<br>\nAfter running the code, we can compare the distribution of the age column before and after the imputation, just to make sure that we are not making any bad decisions:\n![Alt text](http://www.swiftpic.org/image.uploads/26-02-2017/original-8579452ad555b4ea57b9a155b38170ac.png)\n\nAfter making sure the distribution will be the same after imutation phase, we can impute the missing age values.<br>","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0.0,"submitTime":0.0,"finishTime":0.0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a user","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"nuid":"6814e751-b5f8-4dc9-a645-287087706987"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":2620379507544993,"guid":"44f72ee2-e128-447d-beb7-6606ce821fe9","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":2.78125,"command":"%md\n### Impute Embarked\nBased on some general ideas on the columns of the Titanic Dataset, prior knowledge and provided information, we can assume that _fare_ and _passenger class_ information can help us retrieve the missing embarkment information.

Random Forest algorithm showed best performance, so we have decided to keep it as our predictive model for this purpose. We have decided to use Area under ROC curve as our metric for model performance, which shows us the power of the model to make a distinction betweeen two groups.<br>\nAfter model exploration and model selection, we were dealing with model robustness. We have managed to represent predictive model with 5 dimensions instead of 17 that we have started with, and keep the model performance. <br>\nDeployed model is scalable and robust, and it can easily work with significantly larger datasets (although the dataset for this problem can not grow significantly).<br><br>\nSome possible improvements for the model might include creating more features from the original dataset, and trying to impute the other missing values or retrieve relevant information from these fields. \n","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0.0,"submitTime":0.0,"finishTime":0.0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a user","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"nuid":"ac4760d1-2a3a-45c2-8f2e-33ab90e024f0"}],"dashboards":[],"guid":"168dae37-ba2f-4b0c-b9ec-12b7f26a800b","globalVars":{},"iPythonMetadata":null,"inputWidgets":{}};</script>
